# Red Wine Quality dataset - analysis

Hello, everyone!

In this repository called Red Wine Quality dataset, you can find the code and link to the dataset/data used to make EDA or statistical analysis.

Citation info for the data itself - Citation info: P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.; Link - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

Also, if you tend to use this code, please contact me before you use it, and after permission, make sure to citate me and the citation for the data above.
In the PDF file, you can find code extracted/knitted from R Studio, and the explanation written below every graphics.

I tried to keep the graphics as simple as possible, but new graphics are incoming in the next PDFs in other repositories.
