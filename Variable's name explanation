Here you can find the explanation of variable names in the dataset called Red Wine Quality dataset.

1.	Fixed acidity – most acids involved with wine are fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily),
2.	Volatile acidity – the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste of the wine,
3.	Citric acid – found in small quantities, citric acid can add „freshness“ and flavor to wine,
4.	Residual sugar – the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it is rare to find wines with less than 1 g/L and wines with greater than 45g/L are considered sweet,
5.	Chlorides – the amount of salt in the wine,
6.	Free sulfur dioxide – the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine,
7.	Total sulfur dioxide - amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine,
8.	Density - the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content,
9.	ph - describes how acidic or basic the wine is, on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale,
10.	Sulphates - a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant,
11.	Alcohol - the percent alcohol content of the wine,
12.	Quality - output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10).
